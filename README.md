Thus, researchers have proposed various polynomials to model the local geoid surface, through which orthometric heights at some known points can be interpolated to other known points (Nwilo et al., 2009; Odumosu et al., 2016; Erol, 2011, Oluyori et al., 2020). The development of local geoid models aims basically at providing GPS users with an optimal transformation model between ellipsoidal heights and orthometric heights with respect to a given levelling datum.
